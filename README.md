# NDX Community Branding Assets
This repository contains various branding assets for [NDX Community](https://www.ndx.xyz/), made by [myself](https://github.com/skonky). The resources in this repository are usually shared in two extensions: .PNG is preferable for most usages, but the vector files (.SVG) allow for resizing.

## Colors

The NDX Community logo comes in two forms of two different color variants. The first brand identity is the 'NDX' logo, consisting of the italicized and capitalized letters NDX, with the distinctive X, which is split on the upper-right tip to allow a red accent color. The second one is a simpler version consisting of just the aforementioned X.

The NDX red, used as the accent color, is **#ff002a**. On a light background, the main text color — or the border color — is to be **#1a1a1a**, while on a dark background, **#f3f3f3** is to be used as the border color, and **#0c0c0c** as the text color.

## Etiquette

The 'NDX' and 'X' versions of the logo may not be used interchangeably. In fact, the 'X' logo may only be used when the 'NDX' logo would otherwise be too small to be easily recognizable. For instance, the 'X' logo is used as the favicon on our website.
