# NDX Community Branding Assets
This repository contains various all branding assets of NDX Community. Please read below for the usage etiquette.

## Colors

The NDX Community logo comes in two forms of two different color variants. The first brand identity is the 'NDX' logo, consisting of the italicized and capitalized letters NDX, with the distinguishing X, which is split on the upper-right tip to allow a red accent color. The second one is a simpler version consisting of just the aforementioned X.

The NDX red, used as the accent color, is **#ff002a**. On a light background, the main text color — or the border color — is to be **#1a1a1a**, while on a dark background, **#f3f3f3** is to be used as the border color, and **#0c0c0c** as the text color.
